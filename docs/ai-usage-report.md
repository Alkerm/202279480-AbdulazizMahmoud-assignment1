# AI Usage Report

## Tools used & use cases
- ChatGPT (CODEX)
  - Drafted the initial HTML structure based on the assignment requirements.
  - Helped summarize resume content into the About and Projects sections.
  - Suggested a dark-first theme approach and the light-mode toggle logic.

- GitHub Copilot
  - Provided intelligent code completion for JavaScript functions.
  - Generated CSS utility patterns for responsive grid layouts and theme transitions.
  - Suggested HTML semantic tags and accessibility attributes.
  - Assisted in debugging JavaScript logic for local storage persistence of theme preferences.
  - Offered inline refactoring suggestions to improve code readability and maintainability.


## Benefits & challenges
- Benefits: Faster layout planning, clearer section structure, and quicker iteration on styling ideas.
- Real-time code suggestions reduced typing overhead; context-aware completions streamlined JavaScript functionality; improved code consistency through suggested patterns.

- Challenges: Needed to review and refine AI-generated copy to match my tone and ensure accuracy, in addition to that some times AI tools stuck in simple errors or they do not do what exactly you want.
- Occasional over-suggestions that required filtering; some JavaScript completions followed verbose patterns that required optimization.

## Learning outcomes
- Improved understanding of CSS variables for theming and responsive grid layouts.
- Reinforced how to organize a small front-end project with clean structure and accessible markup.
- Deepened knowledge of JavaScript best practices through Copilot's suggested patterns.
- Enhanced appreciation for semantic HTML and accessibility standards by reviewing Copilot's ARIA recommendations.
- Learned efficient workflow strategies: using AI completions to accelerate development while maintaining code quality through careful review.

## Responsible use & modifications
- Verified all AI suggestions and aligned content with the assignment requiremnts.
- Edited and rewrote sections that were too generic or overstated.
- Checked HTML/CSS/JS for correctness and made final design decisions myself.
- Ensured the final submission reflects my own work and academic integrity.
- **Copilot-specific modifications:** Reviewed all auto-generated code snippets for efficiency and correctness; refactored verbose completions into cleaner logic; validated that CSS transitions work across browsers; tested JavaScript theme toggle functionality thoroughly; ensured all generated code follows the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS constraint (no frameworks or libraries).
- Maintained transparency about AI assistance while ensuring the final implementation demonstrates genuine understanding of web development concepts.
