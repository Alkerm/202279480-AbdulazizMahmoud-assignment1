# AI Usage Report

## Tools used & use cases
- ChatGPT (CODEX)
  - Drafted the initial HTML structure based on the assignment requirements.
  - Helped summarize my resume content into the About and Projects sections.
  - Suggested a dark-first theme approach and the light-mode toggle logic.
  - Code generation and quick reviews for HTML/CSS/JS cleanup.
  - Documentation support for README and AI usage reporting.
  - UI/UX design suggestions for layout, typography, and theming.

- GitHub Copilot
  - Provided intelligent code completion for JavaScript functions.
  - Generated CSS utility patterns for responsive grid layouts and theme transitions.
  - Assisted in debugging JavaScript logic and syntax errors.
  - Offered inline refactoring suggestions to improve code readability and maintainability.


## Benefits & challenges
- Benefits: Faster layout planning, clearer section structure, and quicker iteration on styling ideas.
- Real-time code suggestions reduced typing overhead; context-aware completions streamlined JavaScript functionality; improved code consistency through suggested patterns.

- Challenges: Needed to review and refine AI-generated copy to match my tone and ensure accuracy, in addition to that some times AI tools stuck in simple errors or they do not do what exactly you want.
- Occasional over-suggestions that required filtering; some JavaScript completions followed verbose patterns that required optimization.

## Learning outcomes
- Improved understanding of CSS variables for theming and responsive grid layouts.
- Reinforced how to organize a small front-end project with clean structure and accessible markup.
- Improved knowledge in JavaScript best practices through Copilot's suggested patterns.
- Enhanced appreciation for semantic HTML and accessibility standards by reviewing Copilot's recommendations.
- Learned efficient workflow strategies: using AI completions to accelerate development while maintaining code quality through careful review.

## Responsible use & modifications
- Checked HTML/CSS/JS for correctness and made final design decisions myself.
- Ensured the final submission reflects my own work and academic integrity.
- Reviewed all auto-generated code snippets for efficiency and correctness; refactored verbose completions into cleaner logic; validated that CSS transitions work across browsers; tested JavaScript theme toggle functionality thoroughly.
